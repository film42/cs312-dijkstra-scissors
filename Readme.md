Dijkstra Scissors
=================

An Intelligent Scissors algorithm that uses Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm to find the optimal (least-cost) paths between selection points in a given image. After completing a path between a pair of adjacent selection points, the algorithm should reset the dist() values on the image graph and continue searching from the next segmentation point.
